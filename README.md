3. `app/users/avatar/upload.php` - Remember to check the size of the uploaded image.
4. `tip` - Remember to show a message when the uploaded image exceeds a certain limit.
5. `app.css:133-140` - You can use object-fit: contain to be able to display different image sizes.
6. `tip` - On profile the navbar is shorter than the content on mobile view.
7. `tip` - On profile you can move the avatar below change password or above email on mobile view.
8. `tip` - On lists, you can use a table to show them because the view list button is moving to the left or to the right depending on the list title length.
